This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Collaboration & Teamwork

If working with a teammate, I would:

- **Use GitHub Issues & PRs** for structured discussion and code review.
- **Ensure clear commit messages** to maintain transparency.
- **Write modular code** to allow for easy expansion.
- **Hold short sync meetings** to align on improvements.
- **Encourage feedback** on PRs and documentation.

## If I Had More Time

- **Add authentication** (e.g., JWT) for secure superhero creation.
- **Improve error handling** with detailed API responses.
- **Implement a database** (PostgreSQL or MongoDB) instead of using an in-memory array.
- **Implement AI capabilites (maybe generate superheroes with 1 click / Add speech capabilites with unique voices, tones, using prompts)
